# QMINSTer- A Quantum/Classical Hybrid Neural Network trained on MINST

A hybrid neural network that combines classical image processing with quantum computing to classify MNIST digits. The architecture processes images through classical convolutional layers, encodes the extracted features into quantum states using 4 qubits, and leverages quantum operations for enhanced pattern recognition before final classification. Built with PyTorch and Qiskit, this proof-of-concept demonstrates how quantum circuits can be integrated into traditional deep learning pipelines.
